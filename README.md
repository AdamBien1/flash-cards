# Flash Cards

Flash Cards is a simple web-app, which allows its users to create and view flash cards. Developed with **HTML5**, **Sass** and **JavaScript**. User's creations are stored locally in Local Storage, from which content for the app is dynamically loaded. Basic form validation has been applied to "register" and "login" form, although the forms themselves do not submit anywhere, as backend is not integrated. Application is also responsive for small screens (mobiles, tablets) and for larger screens (laptops, others).
